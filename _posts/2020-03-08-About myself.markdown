I am a Data Scientist working at an Analytics Consulting company. My skillset mainly focuses on the predictive analytics (Demand Forecasting and Revenue Optimization), but also covers the Manufacturing Process Optimization and Natural Language Processing Applications, such as custom word embedding, topic modeling, and speech recognition.

## Acedemic Background
I pursued Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Statistics, and Master of Science in Statistics with analytics concentration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Leveraging Industrial Engineering which focuses on efficiency and optimization, I fulfilled my desire to learn Statistics, and gained insights how to communicate with data.


## Skill

Studying both Engineering and Statistics, I have been working with both __Python and R for more than 4 years__. Also, as working as an all-rounder Data Scientist, I do have the hand-on experience working with:

* SQL / SSMS for database (>2 years)
* Tensorflow / Keras for deep learning and NLP applications (>2 year)
* Azure Data Factory / Data Bricks for ETL and Pipeline (>1 year)
* AWS EC2 for a cloud platform (>2 years)
* Tableau / PowerBI for visualization (>1 year)


## Project 

Below is the list of a few projects I have done both while pursuing degrees and while in industry. Among many, these are the ones that I am most proud of.


1. __Revenue Forecasting__
	* Client Industry: 			Manufacturing
    * Objective:				To build a frame work that basically uses past 3 years order intake and sales data to forecast the future 12 months. Additional functionalities, such as ensembling the best results or custom user input, were available.
    * Tools: 					R, SSMS, SparkR, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Tableau, Power BI
	* Time Series techniques: 		TSLM, ARIMA, Holt-winter, Facebook Prophet, TBATS, Moving Averages (Simple, Exponential, Weighted)
	* Machine Learning techniques: XGBoost Regressor, Neural Network
	* Deliverables:			Code base in Databricks, Data Factory Pipelines as a framework, Document for a user guide, and Tableau & Power BI Dashboards
	
2. __Manufacturing Process Optimization__
	* Client Industry: 			Chemical
    * Objective:				(1) To build a framework with predictive models that predict the amount of the waste and the amount of two catalysts by using process and lab data. (2) To build a framework with optimization flow that minimizes the waste generated by optimizing the process variables while satisfying the constraints given by two catalysts.
    * Tools: 					Python, AWS EC2
	* Machine Learning Techniques: XGBoost Regressor, Scipy.optimize
	* Deliverables:				Modeling code base, Preprocessed Data, Pickled predictive model objects, Optimization code base, User guide for modeling and optimization stages
	
3. __Natural Language Processing Applications__
	* Type: 			R&D
    * Objective:				(1) To build the custom word embeddings by industry and a interactive visualization for a showcase. (2) Incorporate Speech Recognition to build a framework to utilize word embedding as a service.
    * Tools: 					Python, AWS EC2
	* Machine Learning Techniques: Tensorflow/Keras, Gensim, NLTK
	* Scrapped Hotel Review data was used. (i.e. book in publishing industry vs. book in hotel industry)
	* Result: Successfully built custom word embedding in a hotel industry. Speech Recognition is available for the action. This is an onging R&D project.

4. __Revenue Optimization__
	* Type: 			Internal Project - Anheuser-Busch InBev Internship
    * Objective:				To build a predictive model framework that takes different promotional prices to choose the optimal one.
    * Tools: 					Python, R, SSMS
	* Machine Learning Techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost Regressor, Neural Network
	* Responsible for two regions: Brazil (R), South Africa (Python)
	* Result: Successfully delivered the frameworks to each region's stakeholders with user guide to customize input data, such as google analytics, sports event, competitor's price index, weather, etc.
	
5. __Clustering Gene Ontology Groups__
	* Type: Bioinformatics Course Project
	* Objective:		To cluster and identify gene ontology groups shared across 5 major psychiatric disorders (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, alcoholism)
	* Benchmark:		"Common NetworkS Revealed (CNSRV)" - Saul et al., "Discriminative Random Walk with Restart (DrawR)" - Gandal et al.
	
6. __Predicting Stock Movements__
	* Type: Machine Learning for Financial Data Course Project
	* Objective:		To build a neural network that takes milli-second limit order book data to predict the future stock movement
	* Python, R, AWS EC2, TensorFlow/Keras, H2O
    * CNN, RNN with LSTM, HRNN, Stacked traditional MLs were evaluated to choose the best model (RNN with LSTM).
