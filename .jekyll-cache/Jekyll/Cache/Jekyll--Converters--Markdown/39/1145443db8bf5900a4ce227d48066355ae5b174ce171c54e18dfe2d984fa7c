I"∑<p>I am a Data Scientist working at an Analytics Consulting company. My skillset mainly focuses on the predictive analytics (Demand Forecasting and Revenue Optimization), but also covers the Manufacturing Process Optimization and Natural Language Processing Applications, such as custom word embedding, topic modeling, and speech recognition.</p>

<h2 id="acedemic-background">Acedemic Background</h2>
<p>I pursued Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Statistics, and Master of Science in Statistics with analytics concentration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Leveraging Industrial Engineering which focuses on efficiency and optimization, I fulfilled my desire to learn Statistics, and gained insights how to communicate with data.</p>

<h2 id="skill">Skill</h2>

<p>Studying both Engineering and Statistics, I have been working with both <strong>Python and R for more than 4 years</strong>. Also, as working as an all-rounder Data Scientist, I do have the hand-on experience working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL / SSMS for database (&gt;2 years)</li>
  <li>Tensorflow / Keras for deep learning and NLP applications (&gt;2 year)</li>
  <li>Azure Data Factory / Data Bricks for ETL and Pipeline (&gt;1 year)</li>
  <li>AWS EC2 for a cloud platform (&gt;2 years)</li>
  <li>Tableau / PowerBI for visualization (&gt;1 year)</li>
</ul>

      <li>Deliverables:				Modeling code base, Preprocessed Data, Pickled predictive model objects, Optimization code base, User guide for modeling and optimization stages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Natural Language Processing Applications</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Type: 			R&amp;D</li>
      <li>Objective:				(1) To build the custom word embeddings by industry and a interactive visualization for a showcase. (2) Incorporate Speech Recognition to build a framework to utilize word embedding as a service.</li>
      <li>Tools: 					Python, AWS EC2</li>
      <li>Machine Learning Techniques: Tensorflow/Keras, Gensim, NLTK</li>
      <li>Scrapped Hotel Review data was used. (i.e. book in publishing industry vs. book in hotel industry)</li>
      <li>Result: Successfully built custom word embedding in a hotel industry. Speech Recognition is available for the action. This is an onging R&amp;D project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revenue Optimization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Type: 			Internal Project - Anheuser-Busch InBev Internship</li>
